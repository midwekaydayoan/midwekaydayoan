The choice to use payday loans is largely driven by unrealistic expectations and by desperation.

Borrowers perceive the loans to be a reasonable short-term choice but express surprise and frustration at how long it takes to pay them back. Seventy-eight percent of borrowers rely on lenders for accurate information, but the stated price tag for an average $375, two-week loan bears little resemblance to the actual cost of more than $500 over the five months of debt that the average user experiences. Desperation also influences the choice of 37 percent of borrowers who say they have been in such a difficult financial situation that they would take a payday loan on any terms offered.
