Midweek payday loans

Only 14 percent of borrowers can afford enough out of their monthly budgets to repay an average payday loan.

The average borrower can afford to pay $50 per two weeks to a payday lender—similar to the fee for renewing a typical payday or bank deposit advance loan—but only 14 percent can afford the more than $400 needed to pay off the full amount of these non-amortizing loans. These data help explain why most borrowers renew or re-borrow rather than repay their loans in full, and why administrative data show that 76 percent of loans are renewals or quick re-borrows while loan loss rates are only 3 percent.
